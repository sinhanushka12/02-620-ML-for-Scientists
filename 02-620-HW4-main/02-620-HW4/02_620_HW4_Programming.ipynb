    "(Option) For your career, we encourage you to upload your work on Github. Github is a repository for programmers. This repo can be useful to your future career, especially if you aim to work in a computational job: provide your Github link to recruiter/research POI. By doing so, you can show your recruiter/research POI that you have fundamental ability to work with deep learning and being able to code Pytorch."

    "Congratulations! Now you understand the basic flow of deep learning workflow. CMU provides a variety of deep learning courses, so we recommend taking any of them if you are interested or strengthen your knowledge and skills in deep learning. If you want to learn general deep learning, consider 11-685 Introduction to Deep learning. Be careful that this course is very hectic. LTI and RI offer domain specific deep learning courses(such as Natural Language Processing, Visual Learning and Recognition). If you want to know deep learning theory, consider 10-707. Please be aware that what we've covered in this assignment is very basic: this is going to be assignment 0 for other deep learning courses. However, we believe that this assignment will work as a immigration assignment to deep learning."
